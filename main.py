        Marie Curie, 7 November 1867 - 4 July 1934, was a Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.

        Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.
